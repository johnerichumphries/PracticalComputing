\noindent The objective of this course is to provide students with the basic knowledge economists need when performing numerical and data analysis. Various programs will be reviewed, particularly focusing on computational advantages and time allocation trade-offs when solving typical problems economists face (e.g. numerical integration, likelihood maximization, bootstrap standard errors). The course is entirely practical and based on knowledge from professors, classes, and autodidact training. It must be noted that this is not a theoretical course on convergence properties or alike nor a class on how computer scientists may code economics problems. Instead, the main goal is to provide economists with the essential computational toolkit to conduct research.

\section{Structural Econometrics with Implementations in Julia}
\noindent \textbf{Host}: Jorge L. Garc\'{i}a.\\
\noindent \textbf{Time}: two weeks.\\
\noindent \textbf{Description}:  Structural models in Economics will be described briefly. In addition, structural and non-structural estimation will be recognized as approaches that enable the user to answer different research questions. Also, parametric and non-parametric assumptions will be discussed as auxiliary means that contribute to recover parameters. This section of the course will build on \citet{keane2011structural} but will be expanded by providing a wide range of computational implementations of their baseline model – a classic discrete choice dynamic programming model of women's labor supply –. The program Julia will be used for these implementations and additional some Python spinets will be provided for the sake of comparison.
